## Title: Restaurant Website Development Using MERN Stack

### 1. Introduction
In today’s digital age, an online presence is essential for restaurants to attract customers and streamline operations. This project aims to develop a fully functional restaurant website that enables users to browse the menu, make reservations, place orders, and provide feedback. Additionally, an admin panel will be implemented to help restaurant staff efficiently manage reservations, food items, and user interactions.

The website will be built using the MERN stack (MongoDB for database management, Express.js and Node.js for the backend, and React for the frontend) to ensure a dynamic and efficient architecture. Tailwind CSS will be used to create a modern, responsive, and visually appealing design.
